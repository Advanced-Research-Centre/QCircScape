# QCircScape

Map the expressibility and reachability of quantum states generated by quantum circuits from a specified gate set and initial state.

## Development plans:
1. Start with H, T, CX gate set
2. Generate prefix free strings for opcode, data
3. Calculate sum of probabilities for executing each code for all Z-basis initial states and Z-axis measurements
4. Try for other gate sets
5. Try for all programs upto a length and for exact length programs

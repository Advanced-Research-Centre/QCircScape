This research applies concepts from algorithmic probability to Boolean and quantum combinatorial logic circuits. Classical and quantum gate sets are compared to select some characteristic sets. The reachability and expressibility in a space-time-bounded setting for these gate sets are enumerated and visualized. These results are studied in terms of computational resources, universality and quantum behavior. 

## Gate sets:
1. X, CCX
2. H, S, CX
3. H, T, CX
4. P(pi/4), RX(pi/2), CX
    - all-to-all topology
    - L topology
    - T topology

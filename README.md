# QCircScape

Map the expressibility and reachability of quantum states generated by quantum circuits from a specified gate set and initial state.

## Development plans:
1. Growth rate of number of programs with qubit count (on X-axis) for each gate-set (multi-line plot).
2. Growth rate of number of programs with qasm loc count (on X-axis) for each gate-set (multi-line plot).
3. Reachability and expressibility plot for increasing operation and qubits for each gate-set. Max 4 or 5 qubits, Max 4 or 5 operations (decide based on how large the set is).
4. Variation of expressibility/reachability for IBM gate-sets with 5 qubits for all-to-all connection, 5-qubit IBM T-shaped topology, 5-qubit line topology.
5. Comparative study of quantum vs. classical
6. Comparative study of universal vs. non-universal
7. Analyse AP for classical and quantum case

## Gate sets:
1. X, CCX
2. H, S, CX
3. H, T, CX
4. U1(pi/4), RX(pi/2), CX
